Custom CMYK: SWOP (Coated), 20%, GCR, Medium


Process printing without black? (CMY with NO K)

Edit: Color Settings. By CMYK, "Custom CMYK". Specify the appropriate ink colors, dot gain. Separation type, GCR. Black generation None. Enter the total ink limit (it will be between 200% and 300%). Note the name at the top of the dialog and hit enter ONCE.

By CMYK, scroll up to "Save CMYK". Save into your color sync profiles folder.

Then CANCEL. You do not want to change your global color settings. Creating the custom CMYK was the goal and you've done it.

Now with a source RGB image open, View: Proof Setup: Custom. Device to Simulate, select the CMY profile you just created.

For CMY output, Save As. Format, Photoshop PDF. By "Color" at bottom right tick "Use Proof Setup". You will notice that "As a Copy" automatically ticks on.

Now in the Save Adobe PDF dialog, select a PDF standard such as PDF/X-1a. By compression, select the appropriate settings. By Output, "Convert to Destination", and make sure the destination is your custom CMY profile.

Now you have CMY PDF output, and you still retain the native source RGB image.

You also have the option of importing the source RGB image into another app such as InDesign, and performing the conversion to CMY when you output from there.

Changing a Four-Color Image to Three Colors

This first step is to change the image to an RGB file so that when we convert it back to a CMYK file later, our special color setting will be read and our conversion to a three-color CMY(K) file will be done. (I use Adobe 1998 as my RGB color setting.) We'll then use a special color setting that converts a four-color CMYK image to a CMY image with no black information.

Call up your color settings by choosing Edit » Color Settings. You'll see the Color Settings dialog box that's shown in Figure 5-27. Under Working Spaces, choose CMYK and then Custom CMYK. 

In the Custom CMYK dialog box, shown in Figure 5-28, put in a descriptive name like: Three Color Conversion. Under ink colors, choose SWOP (coated). Leave dot gain at Standard and 20%. Under Separation Options, choose GCR, and then set the Black Generation to None. Set the black ink limit to 0% and the total ink limit to 300%. 

Click OK (twice), and all your new settings are ready to go. Now convert your image to RGB, as in Figure 5-29. When you convert your image from its current RGB state to CMYK (Image » Mode » CMYK Color), Photoshop will read the settings you have put in and convert the image without a black channel back into CMYK, and you'll end up with a three color image (Figure 5-30). Notice how there is only a slight change to your image (as opposed to Figure 5-26) The black channel is now empty of color information, but the texture is still there.

Made Black (K) with CMY only

In PS 7, Go to Edit > Color Settings > In the Working Spaces area where it says CMYK, in the scroll down menu, select Custom CMYK (at this point, you'll want to write down the Name, at the top, so you can revert to those settings once this little experiment is over); once you wrote down that Name, change the Black Generation to None and name that setting (let's say Black Generation - None) > click OK.

Go back to your Photoshop doent and change the color mode to RGB, then change it to CMYK again...Voila! Look at the Channel Palette, there is no black in the Black Channel.

It's the fact of changing those settings and then going from RGB to CMYK that will change the Black.

I learned that in Dan Margulis' book: Professional Photoshop
